I completed my Master's degree in Mechatronics at the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/">University of Strasbourg</a>, with a strong focus on embedded Artificial Intelligence at the edge (Edge AI) through hardware–software co-design.

During my internship at <a href="https://www.idemoov.fr/">iDEMoov</a>, my passion for the fascinating field of Edge AI deepened even further, especially since optimization has always been one of my key strengths.

To pursue my goal of becoming a researcher in this domain, I am currently seeking a PhD position in one of the following areas:

- AI hardware accelerator co-design for resource-constrained systems,
- Hardware-aware AI software and algorithmic optimization,
- Neural Architecture Search for hardware-constrained environments.

As of November 4, 2025, I have a very promising prospect at a well-known university, and I will update this page as soon as I have more news!

When I’m not optimizing AIs, I enjoy racquet sports (especially table tennis), video games, cinema, water sports such as canoeing and kayaking, and I take great satisfaction in keeping everything meticulously clean.
