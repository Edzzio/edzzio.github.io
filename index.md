Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a

	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. I was a JHU-Amazon AI2AI fellow, a Fred Jelinek fellow, and
an IEEE Rising Star in Signal Processing.<br><br>

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->
