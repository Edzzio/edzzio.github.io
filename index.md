As of the time of writing, I am completing my master's degree in Mechatronics at the <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">University of Strasbourg</a>, with a strong focus on embedded Artificial Intelligence, more specifically, Edge AI.

During my internship in Edge AI at <a href="https://www.idemoov.fr/">iDEMoov</a>, my passion for this fascinating field has only grown, particularly as optimization is one of my key strengths.

To pursue my goal of becoming a researcher in this domain, I will soon begin a PhD at the <a href="https://ijl.univ-lorraine.fr/">Institut Jean Lamour</a> at the <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/">University of Lorraine</a>. My research will focus on designing a novel hardware architecture for optimized neural network deployment, under the supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/slavisajovanovic">Slavisa Jovanovic</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naeem-ramzan-frse-smieee-sfhea-97685218/?originalSubdomain=uk">Naeem Ramzan</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-sellami-475ab3177/">Youssef Sellami</a>.

When I'm not optimizing AIs, I enjoy racquet sports, especially table tennis, as well as video games, cinema, water sports like canoeing and kayaking, and rigorously cleaning everything.
